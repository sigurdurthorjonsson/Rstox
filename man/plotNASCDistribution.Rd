\title{Plot NASC distribution to file}
\usage{
plotNASCDistribution(projectName, format = "png", filetag = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{projectName}{The name or full path of the project, a baseline object (as returned from \code{\link{getBaseline}} or \code{\link{runBaseline}}, og a project object (as returned from \code{\link{openProject}}).}

\item{format}{The file format of the saved plot, given as a string naming the function to use for saving the plot (such as bmp, jpeg, png, tiff), with \code{filename} as its first argument. Arguments fo the functions are given as \code{...}. Dimensions are defaulted to width=5000, height=3000, resolution to 500 dpi. If \code{format} has length 0, the plot is shown in the graphics window, and not saved to file.}

\item{filetag}{A character string to append to the file name (before file extension).}

\item{...}{Parameters passed on from other functions.}
}
\value{
Plot saved to file
}
\description{
Plots both original and resampled NASC distributions;
histogram of NASC transect means together with distribution of resampled NASC values (line).
Probability densities, component density, are plotted (so that the histogram has a total area of one).
Plot is exported to a tif- or png-file
}
\examples{
projectName <- "Test_Rstox"
# Run bootstrap before plotting:
boot <- runBootstrap(projectName, nboot=10, seed=1, bootstrapMethod="AcousticTrawl")
plotNASCDistribution(projectName)
