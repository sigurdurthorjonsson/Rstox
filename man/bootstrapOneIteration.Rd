\title{Run one bootstrap iteration of biotic stations and acoustic data}
\usage{
bootstrapOneIteration(i, projectName, assignments, strata, psuNASC = NULL,
  stratumNASC = NULL, resampledNASC = NULL,
  startProcess = "TotalLengthDist", endProcess = "SuperIndAbundance",
  seedV = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{i}{The boostrap iteration number.}

\item{projectName}{The name or full path of the project, a baseline object (as returned from getBaseline() or runBaseline()), og a project object (as returned from open).}

\item{assignments}{Trawl assignment from baseline.}

\item{strata}{The strata of the survey.}

\item{psuNASC}{MeanNASC from baseline.}

\item{stratumNASC}{Strata NASC estimates from getNASCDistr(baseline).}

\item{resampledNASC}{Resampled NASC distribution.}

\item{startProcess}{The start process of the bootstrapping, being the first process before which biostations has been assigned and NASC values have been calculated.}

\item{endProcess}{The end process of the bootstrapping, being the process returning a matrix containing the following columns: "Stratum", "Abundance", "weight", and grouping variables such as "age", "SpecCat", "sex".}

\item{seedV}{A vector of seeds. seedV[i] is used.}
