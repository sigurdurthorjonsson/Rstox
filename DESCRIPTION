Description: This package contains most of the functionality of the StoX
    software, which is used for assessment of fish and other marine resources based
    on biotic and acoustic survey and landings data, among other uses. Rstox is
    intended for further analyses of such data, facilitating iterations over an
    arbitrary number of parameter values and data sets.
