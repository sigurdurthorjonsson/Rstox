Description: This package contains some of the functionality of the StoX software, which is used for assessment of fish and other marine resources based on biotic and acoustic survey and landings data, among other uses. This version of Rstox is intended for making the continued use of surveyPlanner possible, after some changes in the R-package environment making it difficult to run previous versions.
