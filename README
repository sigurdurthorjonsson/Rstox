# Rstox version: 1.8.1 (latest alpha, 2018-03-01)
# R version: 3.4.3

# The package Rstox contains most of the functionality of the stock assesment utility StoX, which is an open source approach to acoustic and swept area survey calculations. Download Rstox from ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Download/Rstox or install by running the following commands in R:

# Install the packages that Rstox depends on. Note that this updates all the specified packages to the latest (binary) version:
dep.pck <- c("data.table", "ggplot2", "pbapply", "rgdal", "rgeos", "rJava", "sp", "XML")
install.packages(dep.pck, repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org", type="binary")

# Install Rstox:
install.packages("ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Download/Rstox/Versions/Alpha/Rstox_1.8.1/Rstox_1.8.1.tar.gz", repos=NULL)

# Alternatively, install the latest development version from GitHub.
# Note that this does not guarantee a stable version.
# For official versions of Rstox, refer to the ftp server ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Download/Rstox/Versions/Alpha/Rstox_1.8.1 as described above.
# Install from github using the devtools package:
# devtools::install_github("Sea2Data/Rstox", ref="develop")

# R should be installed as the 64 bit version (and 64 bit version ONLY for Windows 10).
# On Windows systems with adminstrator requirements, it is recommended to install R in C:/users/<user>/documents/R.

# Note that 64 bit Java is required to run Rstox
# On Windows, install Java from this webpage: https://www.java.com/en/download/windows-64bit.jsp,
# or follow the instructions found on ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Tutorials/
# On Mac, getting Java and Rstox to communicate can be challenging.
# If you run into problems such as "Unsupported major.minor version ...", try the following:
# Update java, on
# 	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
# If this does not work install first the JDK and then the JRE:
# 	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
# 	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
# You may want to check that the downloaded version is first in the list by running the following in the Terminal:
# 	/usr/libexec/java_home -V
# 	java -version
# Then run this in the Terminal.app:
# 	sudo ln -s $(/usr/libexec/java_home)/jre/lib/server/libjvm.dylib /usr/local/lib
# 	sudo R CMD javareconf
# Open R (close and then open if already open) and install rJava:
# 	install.packages('rJava', type='source')
# Then the installed Rstox should work.


# Release notes:

# 1. Removed the function baseline2ECA(), which is covered by baseline2eca().

# 2. Added the option of downloading all seralno from a year if serialno is not set.

# 3. Added the function surveyPlanner() used to generate parallel or zigzag transects.

# 4. Added the function plotStratum() for plotting the output from surveyPlanner().

# 5. Added the functions getProjString(), projectMatrixList(), spatial2matrixList(), matrixList2multipolygon(), multipolygon2spatial(), isSpatial(), isMatrixList(), isMultipolygon(), matrixListLevel(), rapplyKeepDataFrames() as utility functions for conversion to and from spatial objects, multipolygons, and lists of matrices, all containing polygons and other spatial data.

# 6. Added the functions geo2xy() for conversion to and from geographic and Cartesian coordinates, polyAreaOld() which is the old polyArea(), and getMatrixList(), getMultipolygon() and getSpatial() for getting a list of matrices, a mutipolygon wkt string or a spatial object respectively.

# 7. Mapped the new funcitons getMultipolygon() and getMatrixList() to the old funcitons matrix2multipolygon() multipolygon2matrix() for backwards compatibility.

# 8. Fixed bug in baseline2eca(), where the stratumNeighbour in the output was not created using matching but simple indexing of the strata present in the resources$covariateLink. Also now the neighbors of each present stratum is matched with the present strata.

# 9. Other minor bug fixes.

# 10. Added the parameter 'run' in getNMDdata(), which if set to FALSE only generates the project names, and does not download data and generate projects.

# 11. Added the function aggregateBySpeciesCategory() which generates a species matrix with biotic stations as rows and station information and the species present in a reference file as columns.

# 12. Added a check for missing not downloaded with getNMDdata().

# 13. Added support for using year or cruise code as 'subset' in getNMDdata().
