# Rstox version: 1.7.1 (latest alpha, 2017-12-20)
# R version: 3.4.2

# The package Rstox contains most of the functionality of the stock assesment utility StoX, which is an open source approach to acoustic and swept area survey calculations. Download Rstox from ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Download/Rstox or install by running the following commands in R:

# Install the packages that Rstox depends on. Note that this updates all the specified packages to the latest (binary) version:
dep.pck <- c("data.table", "ggplot2", "pbapply", "rgdal", "rgeos", "rJava", "sp", "XML")
install.packages(dep.pck, repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org", type="binary")

# Install Rstox:
install.packages("ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Download/Rstox/Versions/Alpha/Rstox_1.7.1/Rstox_1.7.1.tar.gz", repos=NULL)

# Alternatively, install the latest development version from GitHub.
# Note that this does not guarantee a stable version.
# For official versions of Rstox, refer to the ftp server ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Download/Rstox/Versions/Alpha/Rstox_1.7.1 as described above.
# Install from github using the devtools package:
# devtools::install_github("Sea2Data/Rstox", ref="develop")

# Note that 64 bit Java is required to run Rstox
# On Windows, install Java from this webpage: https://www.java.com/en/download/windows-64bit.jsp,
# or follow the instructions found on ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Tutorials/
# On Mac, getting Java and Rstox to communicate can be challenging.
# If you run into problems such as "Unsupported major.minor version ...", try the following:
# Update java, on
# 	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
# If this does not work install first the JDK and then the JRE:
# 	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
# 	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
# You may want to check that the downloaded version is first in the list by running the following in the Terminal:
# 	/usr/libexec/java_home -V
# 	java -version
# Then run this in the Terminal.app:
# 	sudo ln -s $(/usr/libexec/java_home)/jre/lib/server/libjvm.dylib /usr/local/lib
# 	sudo R CMD javareconf
# Open R (close and then open if already open) and install rJava:
# 	install.packages('rJava', type='source')
# Then the installed Rstox should work.


# Release notes:

# 1. Fixed bug in reportAbundance_SweptAreaTotal() where the column SpecCat was missing.

# 2. Fixed bug in plotAbundance_AcousticTrawl() and plotAbundance_SweptAreaLength(), where missing values were shown as the lowest value minus 1. Now these are shown as NA to the left of the plot (using the new funciton factorNAfirst()).

# 3. Fixed bug in imputeByAge() where no unknown ages resulted in a different output from distributeAbundance(). 

# 4. Moved warnings due to no unknown or no known ages from distributeAbundance() to imputeByAge().

# 5. Changed rownames of the output from imputeByAge() to the same as the names of the bootstrap runs.

# 6. Replaced the funciton wkt2MULTIPOLYGON() by matrix2multipolygon(), and added the reversed funciton multipolygon2matrix(). See ?polyArea for use of these funciotns.

# 7. Removed bug in reportAbundanceAtLevel(), where grp2 was left out form the output when plotOutput=TRUE,

# 8. Fixed unwanted removal of points in plotAbundance() when CV values were outside of the ylim. Now lines will still show. Also added the option of maxcv=TRUE, which adjusts the upper ylim to the maximum CV if above 1.
