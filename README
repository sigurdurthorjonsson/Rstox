# Rstox version: 1.9.1 (latest alpha, 2018-08-28)
# R version: 3.5.0

# The package Rstox contains most of the functionality of the stock assesment utility StoX, which is an open source approach to acoustic and swept area survey calculations. Download Rstox from ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Download/Rstox or install by running the following commands in R:

# Install the packages that Rstox depends on. Note that this updates all the specified packages to the latest (binary) version:
dep.pck <- c("data.table", "ggplot2", "pbapply", "rgdal", "rgeos", "rJava", "sp", "XML")
install.packages(dep.pck, repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org", type="binary")

# Install Rstox:
install.packages("ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Download/Rstox/Versions/Alpha/Rstox_1.9.1/Rstox_1.9.1.tar.gz", repos=NULL)

# Alternatively, install the latest development version from GitHub.
# Note that this does not guarantee a stable version.
# For official versions of Rstox, refer to the ftp server ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Download/Rstox/Versions/Alpha/Rstox_1.9.1 as described above.
# Install from github using the devtools package:
# devtools::install_github("Sea2Data/Rstox", ref="develop")

# R should be installed as the 64 bit version (and 64 bit version ONLY for Windows 10. To do this, uncheck the box "32-bit Files" when selecting components to install. If you are re-intalling an R that has both 32 and 64 bit, you will need to uninstall R first).
# On Windows systems with adminstrator requirements, it is recommended to install R in C:/users/<user>/documents/R.

# Note that 64 bit Java is required to run Rstox
# On Windows, install Java from this webpage: https://www.java.com/en/download/windows-64bit.jsp,
# or follow the instructions found on ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Tutorials/
# On Mac, getting Java and Rstox to communicate can be challenging.
# If you run into problems such as "Unsupported major.minor version ...", try the following:
# Update java, on
# 	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
# If this does not work install first the JDK and then the JRE:
# 	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
# 	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
# You may want to check that the downloaded version is first in the list by running the following in the Terminal:
# 	/usr/libexec/java_home -V
# 	java -version
# Then run this in the Terminal.app:
# 	sudo ln -s $(/usr/libexec/java_home)/jre/lib/server/libjvm.dylib /usr/local/lib
# 	sudo R CMD javareconf
# Open R (close and then open if already open) and install rJava:
# 	install.packages('rJava', type="binary")
# If this fails, try installing from source instead using install.packages('rJava', type='source')
# Then the installed Rstox should work.


# Release notes Rstox_1.9.1:

# 1. Fixed bug in getNMDinfo("v"), where the returned data frame only contained NA.

# 2. Fixed bug in surveyPlanner(), where the output data frame 'Transect' contained stratum indices instead of stratum names.

# 3. Changed the output of getNMDinfo("taxa") to have one column per species, with the scientific, norwegian, english and russian name as columns.

# 4. Fixed bug in plotStratum(), where transect=FLASE did not suppress plotting transects, whereas transect=NULL did. In the new version all values other than TRUE suppresses plotting transects.

# 5. Fixed bug in getNMDinfo("platform") and getNMDinfo("v"), where the columns validFrom and validTo did not correspond to the correct platform codes/names due to a sorting of these dates.

# 6. Fixed bug in getNMDinfo, where UTF-8 encoding was ineffective (the corresponding bugfix in Version 1.3.2 was discovered to be ineffective). 

# 7. Removed error in readStrataPolygons(), where multipolygons were not supported. Now only the first polygon of multipolygons are kept in the outputs 'lonlat' and 'lonlatAll', and all are kept in 'lonlatFull'.

# 8. Changed surveyPlanner() to discard strata with zero effort, but keep those strata in the Input list for plotting.

# 9. Added the parameter "JavaMem" in bootstrap functions, used for setting the Java memory of each bootstrap replicate (useful to reduce memory for parallelized bootstrapping).

# 10. Added the functions writeBioticXML() and writeAcousticXML() (with supporting functions), which takes a data frame as input and writes the data frame to an XML file given XML-schema (XSD) files shipped along with Rstox. The input data frame has one column per combination of variable and attribute, where the attributes are coded into the column names in the following manner: variableName..attributeName.attributeValue. If there are variables with identical names at different levels in the XMl hierarchy, the level (i.e., the name of the parent node) can be given in the column name by separation of a dot: variableName.level.

# 11. Removed LICENSE file, as this is unambigously stated in the DESCRIPTION file.

# 12. Changed from using 'formulardato' to using 'sistefangstdato' in baseline2eca().

# 13. Fixed bug in runBaseline(), where exportCSV==TRUE now implies resetting (and rerunning) the baseline.

# 14. Changed 'covariateLink' in the output from baseline2eca() to link to the union of the covariate values in biotic and landing (and not only to landing as before). Also changed name of the thrid column of the data frames in covariateDefinition from "Value" to "Definition".

# 15. Removed the covariate 'season', which was used in conjunction to 'year'. Now, these are concatinated in the temporal covariate.
